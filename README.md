This project is a full-stack e-commerce web application developed using Java Servlets, JSP (JavaServer Pages), and JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). It provides a platform for users to browse products, manage their cart, place orders, and more. Technologies Used Backend: Java, Servlets, JDBC Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript Database: MySQL Server: Apache Tomcat IDE: Eclipse Key Features User Authentication: Secure login/logout functionality with encrypted passwords. Product Management: Browse products by categories and search functionality. Cart Management: Add products to the cart, update quantities, and remove items. Order Management: Place orders with multiple products. Track order status (pending, shipped, delivered). User Profile: Update personal information. View order history and track previous purchases. <h1>Setup Instructions</h1> Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/mongamnarendra/E-Commerce-JSP-SERVLETS.git Set up MySQL: Create a new database named ecommerce_db. Execute SQL scripts in the database-scripts folder to create tables and insert data. Configure database connection: Update the database connection settings in the project to match your local MySQL configuration. Build and run the application: Use an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ. Deploy the application to Apache Tomcat.

The application performs CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) through JDBC, demonstrating hands-on SQL experience. Key JDBC functionalities implemented: Database Connection: Used DriverManager to establish connections to MySQL. Connection pooling handled for efficient resource management. CRUD Operations: Create: Insert new users, products, and orders into the database. Read: Fetch product details, user profiles, and order history using SQL SELECT queries. Update: Update user information, cart quantities, and order status. Delete: Remove items from cart or delete user requests. Prepared Statements: Used PreparedStatement for secure query execution to prevent SQL injection attacks. Transaction Management: Ensured atomic operations during order placement (multiple inserts/updates) to maintain database integrity. Example: JDBC usage for fetching products code: Connection conn = DBConnection.getConnection(); String sql = "SELECT * FROM products"; PreparedStatement pst = conn.prepareStatement(sql); ResultSet rs = pst.executeQuery(); while(rs.next()) { Product p = new Product(); p.setId(rs.getInt("id")); p.setName(rs.getString("name")); p.setPrice(rs.getDouble("price")); productList.add(p); }
